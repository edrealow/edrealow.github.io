            <p>"In 4th grade, I moved to India. The transition was extremely<br><br>
                difficult; I was a very shy girl, so I was always an outcast<br><br>
                and didn't make any friends until 3 years later. When I was<br><br>
                in 8th grade, there was this group of seniors that would always<br><br>
                act weirdly around me. When I sat on the bus with them, they<br><br>
                would get extremely close and purposely fall on me during turns,<br><br>
                things like that. They would always make me uncomfortable."<br>
