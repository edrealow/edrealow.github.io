            <p>"I didn't grow up in an environment where I was loved much. <br><br>
                    For as long as I can remember, I'd always had to fend<br><br>
                    for myself. I had my family, but my family environment <br><br>
                    wasn't the best. My parents were busy with their own <br><br>
                    problems, and I didn't get along well with my sibling. <br><br>
                    Although I had a few friends, I still couldn't really get <br><br>
                    the degree of love that I should've received growing up."<br>
